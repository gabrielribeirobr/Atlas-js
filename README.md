# 🌍 Geo Atlas

**Geo Atlas** is a front-end project that uses the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to display geographical information about continents and their countries. It provides a clean, responsive, and interactive interface where users can explore countries by continent and view details like flags, currencies, and neighboring nations.
